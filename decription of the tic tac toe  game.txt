Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C
📌 Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell with their respective symbol—X or O. The goal is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three matching symbols before the opponent does. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.

This project implements Tic-Tac-Toe in C, using a console-based interface. The game allows two players to compete in a turn-based manner.

🎮 Features
✅ Two-player mode (X vs. O)
✅ Real-time board display
✅ Win/Draw detection
✅ Input validation (prevents invalid moves)
✅ Simple and interactive UI

💻 Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Concepts Applied:
2D Arrays (Game Board)
Loops (Game Flow)
Conditional Statements (Win Check, Input Validation)
Functions (Modular Code)
📜 Rules of the Game
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell.
The first player to place three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
If the board is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
The game does not allow overwriting an already occupied cell.


🛠️ How the Game Works
The game starts by displaying an empty 3x3 board.
Players are prompted to enter the row and column number (1-3) for their move.
After each move, the program:
Updates the board.
Checks for a winner or a draw.
If no winner, switches the turn to the next player.
The game ends when a player wins or the board is full.

📝 Future Enhancements
🔹 Implement single-player mode (AI opponent).
🔹 Add a graphical interface (GUI version).
🔹 Introduce custom board sizes (e.g., 4x4, 5x5).
🔹 Save game history and scores in a file.

📢 Conclusion
This Tic-Tac-Toe game in C is a great way to understand arrays, loops, and game logic. It serves as a foundational project for developing more advanced games. Future improvements can include AI, graphical interface, or multiplayer over a network.
